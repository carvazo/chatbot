## Problem Statement ##


As business is growing in terms of transactions and visitors, the current business operation proportionaly increases, requiring significant labor hours. Most of user inquiry is simple, therefore the answering task is repetitive and monotonous. Despite of prepared FaQ information, users prefer to make call or to have short chat to human directly. Saving internal resource and capturing the leads from users, the both are crucial objectives for Carvazo's sustainable growth. 

TaeRyang Yoo - the CEO of Carvazo - realized its current customer service has certain limitation and should be developed for further business growth. An automated chat can be solution, but its developing team spends all of time to develop Carvazo's first mobile app for iOS and Androids, which resulted in lack of exploring the newest technologies, such as AI and Bot Framework.
